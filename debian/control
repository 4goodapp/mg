Description: public domain Micro Emacs derivative
 Mg is intended to be a small, fast, and portable editor for people who
 can't (or don't want to) run GNU Emacs for one reason or another.  It
 strives to be key compatible because there shouldn't be any reason to
 learn more than one Emacs flavor.
 .
 This variant of mg is called mg2a to not conflict with the default
 Debian/Ubuntu version.  It comes with more features and has fewer
 dependencies.
