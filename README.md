Micro Emacs
===========

This is OpenBSD Mg, a public domain [Micro Emacs][1] derivative.  It was
created in 1986 based on the original MicroEMACS by Dave Conroy.  The
history is long and intertwined with other spin-offs but goes basically
like this:

* Nov 16, 1986: First release to mod.sources
* Mar  3, 1987: First Release (mg1a) via comp.sources.unix
* May 26, 1988: Second release: (mg2a) via comp.sources.misc
* Jan 26, 1992: Linux port released by Charles Hedrick. This version
  later makes its way onto tsx-11, Infomagic, and various other Linux
  repositories.
* Feb 25, 2000: First import into the OpenBSD tree, where it is
  currently maintained with contributions from many others.
* May  8, 2016: First import from OpenBSD 5.9 to [GitHub][]
